okay so uh today we're going to talk about reproducible research this week uh it's a lot about communicating uh the models that we're developing so I'm going to walk you through a method to do that we're going to use something called a quarto file which is a different type of file type inside vs code but I'm talking through why this is important for um for the field generally and then how to use a little bit of markdown which is another kind of um uh programming language that's really easy to use you've probably already used it and don't even know um so let's just let's just dive into this I'm trying to get through it pretty quick so like I said we're going to talk a little bit about uh reproducible research why that's important then we'll talk about um are mark it down one or sorry about that but there will be some references to our in this that we can kind of ignore because they totally apply to what we're doing uh this weekend by using python so just I'll show you those but um just don't worry about that and then I'll I'm going to switch over to vs code and Show an example of how to use this but again the goal here at the end is to have some skills in the area of developing this you know kind of kind of high-end HTML output all right that we can actually publish online so we can talk through their problem we can see you know what the analytical output is draw conclusions put in graphics all sorts of stuff and then publish that online or at an HTML file that we can share really easily and it's super lightweight so one example of why this is important we're talking about transparency and our ability to communicate our results came from beggarly and combs is this really famous talk in in 2010 uh and they they just went through the details associated with a particular study uh that they were looking at that they had some questions about really associated with cancer research so they were in the field of bioinformatics all right so it really it was highly influential and kind of created this entire you know kind of movement around you know open source materials and how important that is all right so they they you know they were trying to replicate which means try to redo a study um child leukemia all right so a really kind of deadly form of cancer in children all right that had been that's shown really good results right um but as it turns out they weren't able to to reproduce it and so when they tried to all right they started with the raw data set and tried to reproduce the results and they were just unable to do that um and so the problem was that the authors of this particular study had not provided any scripts or discussion of the data that they how they manipulated it or the um kind of the cleaning process or choices that they made leading up to the analytical analysis so they had the original kind of raw data and they had the results but they really had nothing as you can see it's kind of obvious nothing in between all right so they went back and they did some real kind of Deep dive they call this a forensic approach where they tried to figure out this question mark right and eventually they found some pretty disturbing errors one which is more common than you might think it's called this kind of off by one error Which hat which means is that they you know they were copying and pasting data into cells in a way that the left column was off so the left was off of the column headers and that created a one by auth error where the data for for a gene was listed in one row was actually above the gene name so instead of getting those rows lined up they were off by one and then they they coded the treatment as a one or a two all right along the way but someone confused what one and two met right so not only do they have this off by one error right but they also started switching essentially the treatment controls which is a which is a huge problem obviously uh and that meant they reported positive effects for the treatment group when it was actually not a positive effect it was a positive effect for the control group and if you know something about controlled studies that means that you know that means that the treatment was actually not effective okay so with strong positive reference for a group that was actually not getting any treatment all right in other words worse than that right the treatment might actually harm people okay so uh it took a long time for them to be able to actually get to the principal investigators here uh because obviously they were very worried about their reputation and grant money uh you know being affected because of this bad work and you know it wasn't until it turns out the principal investigators had lied in other ways pretending to be a road scholar when they're not uh that the information came to light and they they stopped it but they were actually treating children um with this uh approach and so you can imagine that is just just a tragic outcome here but luckily it was stopped and so it became a really famous uh a famous case and so I'm not saying like you know that we don't have high stakes like uh you know pediatric cancer research but you know we are doing some things that affect people's lives and then it's also um it kind of makes us up our game a little bit like if we produce the results in a way where other people can pick it up and take a look at it or say hey we don't have anything to hire because we think we did a really good job here but if we did let us know all right so there's easy ways to do this and one of the easy ways to do it is using code in combination with markdown something we're going to work through called Corto and we're going to use dot qmd files where we can actually just write and we can embed images and we can put the code right there then we can publish it so everybody can take a look at it and check our work and it's actually a really nice way to publish projects that you've worked on and build a portfolio it's a simple language and we're going to walk through how to do that so we can get through um so we can adhere to these best practices of kind of uh open data science and reproducibility and then also I mean it's just good for us because we can we can publish our projects and they can look pretty awesome all right so I'm going to show you guys how to do that we're going to um I'm gonna stop this lecture here uh after we talk about just real quick um go through some of this I'm gonna show you that the markdown language generally okay so we're gonna weave and here you can just replace this R reference here in R studio with with vs code we're just going to weave in markdown and python I'll show you how to do that and we'll do this in this very lightweight way all right where we can essentially compile these two things markdown is just basically text or or table setting you know it's kind of a cheat code for for HTML all right so it's a wrapper for HTML and then our code will produce the code that we want and we can weave those two things together and create a really beautiful kind of Standalone document that can be published online and I'll show you how to do that okay all these things are true here these table settings all that so I'm going to stop here and then we're going to switch over to uh vs code and I'll have a short video
